# Transition

Sprout UI provides a transition utility that let you easily add enter/leave transitions to component parts.

If you've ever used Transition component from [Vue](https://vuejs.org/guide/built-ins/transition.html) or [HeadlessUI](https://headlessui.com/react/transition),
then you're good to go. Sprout UI provides a similar way to add transitions to component parts.

Let's look at the following example popover component:

<div>
  <.tooltip_example />
</div>

```heex
<Overlay.popover :let={api} offset={12} placement="top">
  <button {api.trigger_attrs}>Toggle</button>
  <div
    data-transition
    data-enter="transition duration-200 ease-in-out"
    data-enter-from="opacity-0"
    data-enter-to="opacity-100"
    data-leave="transition duration-300 ease-in-out"
    data-leave-from="opacity-100"
    data-leave-to="opacity-0"
    {api.panel_attrs}
  >
  </div>
</Overlay.popover>
```

All you need to do is just adding data attributes to the component part that you want to have transitions.

The following transition attributes are supported:

- `data-transition`: requried if the component part should have transitions
- `data-enter`: classes added to the transitioning element during the entire enter stage
- `data-enter-from`: classes added to the transitioning element before the enter stage
- `data-enter-to`: classes added to the transitioning element after the enter stage
- `data-enter-ended`: classes added to the transitioning element when the enter transition is done
- `data-leave`: classes added to the transitioning element during the entire leave stage
- `data-leave-from`: classes added to the transitioning element before the leave stage
- `data-leave-to`: classes added to the transitioning element after the leave stage
- `data-leave-ended`: classes added to the transitioning element when the leave transition is done
